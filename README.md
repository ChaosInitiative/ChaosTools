# SDK Launcher

This is the SDK launcher for chaos engine games such as Portal 2: Community Edition, which serves a recreation of Valve's old Source SDK launcher tool.

The tool can be used to launch tools like hammer or the game itself and manage chaos source mods.

## Installation

This software is shipped along with the Portal 2: Community Edition SDK. It can be used standalone for other projects independently, but no pre-compiled binaries will be served on this repository

## Currently in-development!

At this time, the program is in a work in progress state and not ready for production use. Use at own risk.
